## Definition

A **job** in **AI Training** is the workload unit submitted to the cluster. A **job** runs as a Docker container within OVHcloud infrastructure.

Each job is linked to a **Public Cloud** project and specifies an amount of resources to use to run the training task along with a Docker image either publicly available, in the **AI Training** shared registry scoped to your project or the private registry of your choosing that you attached. For the latter, see [OVHcloud documentation on how to attach a private registry](../attach-private-registry).

## Considerations

> [!warning]
> * A job will run indefinitely until completion or manual interruption.

-   [Data](../data) can be attached to a job to serve either/both as input for your training workload or output (e.g.Â model weights).
-   The minimum resource requirement for a job is 1 GPU. If you do not customise you GPU resource request, the default requested is 1. CPU and Memory resources are not customisable.
-   Billing for **jobs** is minute based and starts at job initialisation until completion. Each commenced minute is billed completely.
-   You can read further on job limitations [here](../capabilities).

## Under the hood

**Jobs** in **AI Training** are Docker containers within OVHcloud infrastructure.
